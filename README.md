# QGPU Test Project

This project aims to explore and test the use of Quantum GPU (QGPU) with Python.

## Project Structure
- `qgpu_test.py`: Example script to test QGPU operations (simulated with Qiskit).
- `requirements.txt`: Required dependencies.

## How to Use
1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the test:
   ```bash
   python qgpu_test.py
   ```

## Note
If you have a specific QGPU library, add it to `requirements.txt` and adapt the script according to the library documentation.
